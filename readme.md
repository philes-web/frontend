# Website Template
This repository serves as an easy-start template for new websites. 

Simply clone the repository into a directory:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:T99/website-template.git my-new-site
```

And then run the init script:

```bash
$ ./init.sh
```

The init script will interactively prompt you for website information and then automatically build the site, correct and fill-in site information, and install the specified NPM packages already included in the provided `package.json`.

And that's it! Your website is ready to go.
